- have each user know its position by knowing a roadspace.uuid

- have a table call roadspace_occupancy which is a dictionary like roadspace.uuid:set(users)

- a roadspaces dictionary which contains roadspace.uuid:roadspace

- This way the simultion can access the roadspace for a user by just finding out its roadspace.uuid, and then looking at the roadspaces dictionary

- Also, the the roadspace_occupancy for any roadspace can be queried the same roadspace.uuid
